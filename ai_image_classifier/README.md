## 🌟 About the Project

In this project, I built an **AI-powered image classification tool** using Python and Streamlit. The application utilizes the **MobileNetV2** model, which is a pre-trained deep learning model known for its efficiency and accuracy in image recognition tasks.  

### 🛠️ Key Features:
- Convert images to arrays using the **NumPy** library.
- Resize images to fit the model's input requirements using **OpenCV**.
- Preprocess and classify images with the **MobileNetV2** library.
- A user-friendly **Streamlit** interface to upload and classify images.
- Displays top-3 predictions with their confidence scores.
